## Implementation of steady state Evolutionary strategy algorithm
<pre>
While fitness of generation is < threshold:

  for every genotype in the generation
    assign random parameters (Weights and biases) to each genotype
    evaluate each genotype and get its fitness score (cumulative reward)
  rank the fitness of all genotypes (from low to high)
  
  for each low fitness individual:
    replace the low fit individual with a high fit individual + adding some variance
  
  calculate the max fitness and average fitness of the current generation
</pre>

#### Here is the output of one training trial of the code 
Note that each training trial will behave differently, this is due to:
 - the randomness of the inital actions every env.reset() command
 - the variance added to the replaced genotypes
